# Production Deployment Fixes for Enhanced Dashboard

## Issue Identified
The production site (libtousa.com) is currently showing 404 errors for dashboard routes because:
1. Frontend is configured with wrong backend URL
2. React SPA is running in development mode instead of serving production build
3. Client-side routing is not properly configured

## Local Fixes Applied ✅
1. **Updated frontend/.env** - Changed backend URL from preview to production:
   ```
   REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://libtousa.com
   ```

2. **Fixed ESLint Issues** - Resolved ProfileTab.js confirm() error

3. **Built Production Version** - Created optimized build in `frontend/build/`

4. **Backend APIs Verified** - All dashboard APIs working correctly

## Required Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Frontend Environment Variables
On the Hostinger server, update the frontend .env file:
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd /home/u224660466/liberia2usa/frontend/

# Update .env file
echo "REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://libtousa.com" > .env
echo "DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_HOST_CHECK=true" >> .env
echo "HOST=0.0.0.0" >> .env
```

### Step 2: Build Production Version
```bash
# Install dependencies if needed
npm install

# Build production version
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Configure Apache to Serve React Build
Update Apache configuration to serve the build files instead of development server:
```bash
# Update .htaccess in public_html to serve React build files
# Point document root to /home/u224660466/liberia2usa/frontend/build/
```

### Step 4: Configure SPA Routing Support
Add to Apache .htaccess for client-side routing:
```apache
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /

# Handle API routes (keep existing)
RewriteRule ^api/dashboard/(.*)$ http://localhost:8001/api/dashboard/$1 [P,L]
RewriteRule ^api/(.*)$ http://localhost:8001/api/$1 [P,L]

# Handle React SPA routing - serve index.html for all non-API routes
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/api/
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### Step 5: Restart Services
```bash
# Stop development server if running
supervisorctl stop frontend

# Restart Apache
sudo systemctl restart apache2

# Restart backend if needed
supervisorctl restart backend
```

## Verification Steps
1. Visit https://libtousa.com - Should show full React homepage
2. Visit https://libtousa.com/dashboard - Should redirect to login or show dashboard
3. Test API calls - Should use https://libtousa.com/api/* endpoints
4. Check browser console - No CORS or loading errors

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend APIs working correctly
- ✅ Local frontend fixes ready
- ⚠️ **Requires manual deployment to production server**

The enhanced dashboard functionality is fully implemented and tested. The production deployment needs to be updated with the correct configuration to serve the React application properly.
