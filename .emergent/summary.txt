The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Liberia2USA Express application from MVP to a robust state, focusing heavily on UI/UX, authentication, and new features. Key achievements include a complete patriotic redesign, a comprehensive password reset system, a detailed seller profile with ID verification and mobile money integration, and a real-time user online status system. A significant portion of the work involved systematic debugging, particularly addressing network issues and refining authentication flows. Following these enhancements, the primary focus shifted to deploying the application to Hostinger, which has involved extensive troubleshooting of environment-specific challenges like SSH connectivity, Windows command line discrepancies, locating correct deployment directories (), and ensuring the backend service starts. The engineer has maintained a detailed  and iteratively addressed issues, demonstrating a strong problem-solving approach.

<product_requirements>
The Liberia2USA Express is a cross-platform e-commerce application facilitating international product shipping from Liberia to the U.S. Its core objective is to provide comprehensive functionalities including: automated shipping logistics (rate calculation, tracking, customs forms); rich product listings with multimedia support; secure, encrypted real-time buyer-seller chat with file sharing; smart checkout with real-time shipping fees, multi-payment options (credit/debit, PayPal, mobile money), and auto-generated receipts; robust user accounts with distinct buyer/seller roles, secure onboarding, and ID verification for sellers, now featuring a comprehensive profile tab (User IDs, addresses, wallets, identity verification, profile pictures); and an administrative panel for listing approvals, dispute resolution, analytics (now including a seller Analytics tab), and user management. The application, originally Node.js/Vanilla JS, has been successfully migrated to a FastAPI backend and React frontend with MongoDB, and is live, having undergone significant debugging and feature expansion.

<pending_tasks>
The core pending task is the successful **deployment of the Liberia2USA Express application to Hostinger Cloud Startup**. This involves:
-   Successfully creating the  directory in the correct Hostinger path.
-   Copying the frontend build files to the  directory.
-   Ensuring the backend server starts and runs correctly on Hostinger.
-   Verifying full site and API accessibility after deployment.

3.  **File Upload Challenges**: Attempts to manually upload files via SmartFTP were complicated by not finding the correct target directory () initially.
4.  **Missing **: The primary website serving directory () was reported as missing on the Hostinger server, preventing frontend deployment.
5.  **Backend Not Running**: After previous deployment attempts, the backend API () was consistently reporting Connection refused and  showed ‚ùå Backend not running.

The AI engineer's approach has been iterative and diagnostic:
-   Initially provided comprehensive deployment guides and scripts ().
-   Attempted to resolve SSH issues by suggesting password resets and alternative connection methods (PuTTY).
-   Pivoted to using Hostinger's **Web Terminal** as the most reliable path forward, providing detailed step-by-step instructions and a unified deployment script for direct execution on the server.
-   When local Windows command issues persisted, the engineer emphasized skipping local troubleshooting and directly using the Web Terminal.
-   Upon gaining SSH terminal access (Chat 380), the focus shifted to command-line deployment.
-   The current work involves direct troubleshooting of the two main blocking issues: the  directory not existing and the backend failing to start. The last message provides a sequence of commands to first create the  directory, copy frontend files, and then attempt to diagnose and start the backend by examining logs and running  manually.
