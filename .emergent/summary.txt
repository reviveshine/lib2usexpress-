The AI engineer successfully guided the user through the complex deployment of the Liberia2USA Express application to Hostinger, transitioning from a problematic  domain to a functional . Key achievements include resolving numerous Python 3.6 compatibility issues with FastAPI dependencies, rectifying incorrect file placements on the server, and configuring  for API routing. The application eventually displayed the intended patriotic theme. The current task is to implement a new Bridging Nations professional homepage design. The process involves updating  and associated CSS, followed by rebuilding and redeploying the frontend. The immediate challenge is a user typo preventing the  update on the server.

<product_requirements>
The Liberia2USA Express is an e-commerce platform for international product shipping from Liberia to the U.S., offering automated shipping logistics, rich product listings, secure real-time buyer-seller chat, smart checkout with multi-payment options, robust user accounts with distinct roles and ID verification, and an administrative panel for management and analytics. The application was migrated from Node.js/Vanilla JS to a FastAPI backend and React frontend with MongoDB. It has undergone significant debugging and feature expansion. The application is currently deployed and functional on , displaying a patriotic red, white, and blue theme. The user's explicit request is to upgrade the homepage design from the current Independence Day theme to a more professional Bridging Nations theme.

The application employs a monorepo structure with  (FastAPI) and  (React), both interacting with MongoDB.



**Key Files/Directories Examined, Modified, or Created:**

*   : The original FastAPI application entry point.
*   : A backup created to preserve the original  content during modifications.
*   : This newly created file serves as the current functional backend entry. It was crucial for deploying the FastAPI app on Hostinger's Python 3.6 environment by replacing  with  decorators for startup/shutdown events, and undergoing several syntax fixes for FastAPI parameters and CORS middleware.
*   , , : These files define the Python dependencies.  (with , , , , etc.) was specifically created and used to resolve Python 3.6 compatibility issues during backend installation.
*   : This file contains the React component for the application's homepage. It currently holds the Independence Day theme and is undergoing an update to the Bridging Nations professional theme.
*   : A backup of the  before applying the Bridging Nations design, ensuring a rollback point for the previous theme.
*   : Configured the  to point to , crucial for the frontend to communicate with the backend on the live domain.
*   : This directory is the web root for . It contains the React production build files (, , ) and an  file.
*   : This Apache configuration file is critical for routing. It contains  and  to proxy all  requests from the domain to the local FastAPI backend running on port 8001.
*   : The executable for the Uvicorn ASGI server. Its execute permissions were explicitly fixed () to allow the backend server to start.

<pending_tasks>
- Successfully update  on the Hostinger server with the new Bridging Nations design.
- Implement the corresponding CSS styling in  (or a new stylesheet) for the Bridging Nations theme.
- Rebuild the frontend application on the user's local Windows machine.
- Upload the newly built frontend files (containing the Bridging Nations design) to the  directory on Hostinger.
- Verify that the updated Bridging Nations design is live and visible on .

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on upgrading the  application's homepage design from the current Independence Day theme to a more professional Bridging Nations theme on .

The AI engineer has provided the new React component code for , which incorporates the Bridging Nations header, map background, updated messaging (Connecting Liberian Heritage with American Opportunity), and new feature cards. A backup of the old  was made at .

The backend FastAPI server is confirmed to be running on Hostinger at  via . This required extensive troubleshooting to ensure Python 3.6 compatibility, including downgrading multiple Python packages (e.g., , , , ) and manually patching  to use Python 3.6-compatible event handlers and fix syntax errors. The backend's API is successfully accessible via  and null.

The frontend React application is deployed to  on Hostinger. An  file is correctly configured to proxy  requests to the backend. The static files (CSS and JS) generated by the React build are present in . However, the  was initially an old static HTML page, which was replaced with the React build's . Despite this, the site still shows an old or blank version, indicating a potential caching or mismatch issue with the actual *content* of the React build. The plan is to rebuild the frontend locally to ensure the latest code and styling are bundled.

Currently, the user is attempting to replace the  content on the Hostinger server, but encountered a typo ( instead of ), which the AI engineer is guiding them to correct.
