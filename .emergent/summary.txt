The previous AI engineer diligently worked on the Liberia2USA Express application, transitioning it from an MVP to a more robust state. The trajectory showcases a systematic approach to feature development, including user authentication enhancements, payment integration, and administrative controls. A significant portion of the work involved extensive debugging and troubleshooting, primarily focused on resolving persistent 503 errors and network connectivity issues related to URL configurations, CORS, and Kubernetes deployment specifics. The engineer consistently used backend testing agents to validate API functionality, which proved crucial in isolating frontend-backend communication problems. This led to refining environment variable usage and API path construction. The work culminated in successfully implementing core features and preparing the application for further development, with a strong focus on ensuring all components function correctly in a production-like environment. The last task initiated was the implementation of a comprehensive password reset system.

<product_requirements>
The Liberia2USA Express application is designed as a cross-platform solution for international product shipping from Liberia to the U.S. Key functionalities include:
1.  **Shipping & Logistics:** Automated rate calculation with major carriers, real-time tracking, and customs form generation.
2.  **Product Listings:** Support for multimedia (video, photos), detailed descriptions, and search tags.
3.  **Secure Buyer-Seller Chat:** Encrypted real-time chat with file sharing and notifications.
4.  **Smart Checkout & Payments:** Secure shopping cart, real-time shipping fee calculation, multi-payment options (credit/debit, PayPal, mobile money), and auto-generated receipts.
5.  **User Accounts:** Separate buyer/seller accounts, secure onboarding with ID verification for sellers, and dedicated dashboards.
6.  **Admin Panel:** Functionality for listing approval, dispute resolution, analytics, and user report management.

The application, initially a Node.js/Vanilla JS app, was migrated to a FastAPI backend and React frontend, retaining MongoDB. So far, foundational setup, multimedia product listings, international shipping, secure chat, and backend payment integration are complete. Frontend work for checkout, cart, and order pages, and specific bug fixes for cart, chat, and registration, including Independence Day themed UI updates, have been implemented. The application is live and has undergone significant debugging, particularly around deployment and network errors.
