The previous AI engineer successfully completed the initial phase of understanding the existing codebase and outlining a plan for the Liberia2USA Express application. They first explored the root directory, identifying , , , , and . Deep dives into  revealed a Node.js/Express/MongoDB stack with routes, models (Mongoose), and middleware for authentication. Frontend exploration showed a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript structure, not React as required. This crucial discovery highlighted a significant technology mismatch. The engineer then summarized these findings, explicitly detailing the gaps between the current LIB MARKETPLACE (Node.js/Vanilla JS) and the desired Liberia2USA Express (FastAPI/React). A multi-phase implementation plan was proposed, covering foundation setup (migration), core features (shipping, multimedia, chat), advanced features (payments, admin), and final testing. The work paused awaiting user confirmation on this comprehensive plan.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build Liberia2USA Express, a cross-platform mobile and web application for international product shipping from Liberia to all U.S. states. Key features include:
1.  **Shipping & Logistics Integration**: Automated shipping rate calculation from multiple carriers (DHL, FedEx, UPS, Aramex), estimated delivery, real-time tracking, customs forms, and compliance.
2.  **Product Listings**: Each listing requires an embedded video (up to 60s), 10 high-resolution photos, detailed description, and optional search tags.
3.  **Secure Buyer-Seller Chat**: Encrypted chat with photo/video sharing, notifications, and abuse reporting.
4.  **Smart Checkout & Payments**: Secure cart, real-time shipping fee calculation, multiple payment methods (credit/debit, PayPal, mobile money), auto-generated receipts/invoices.
5.  **User Account System**: Separate buyer (U.S.) and seller (Liberia) accounts, secure onboarding/ID verification for sellers, and dashboards for order, sales, shipping, and feedback management.
6.  **Admin & Moderation Panel**: Dashboard for listing approval/flagging, dispute resolution, analytics, and user report management.

Technical & UI/UX requirements specify mobile-first design, web compatibility, fast/intuitive interface, warm/clean theme, and optimization for low bandwidth.

The existing codebase, LIB MARKETPLACE, is a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB and a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend, featuring basic user authentication, product listings, and seller/buyer interfaces. The primary task is to bridge this existing setup with the new requirements and mandated tech stack (FastAPI, React, MongoDB).
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Current Stack**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB ORM), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JWT for authentication.
-   **Required Stack**: FastAPI (Python), React, MongoDB.
-   **Core Features**: International shipping API integrations, multimedia handling (video/images), real-time WebSocket-based chat, secure payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal), user role management, admin panel functionalities.
-   **Deployment**: Kubernetes container environment, Supervisor for process management.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application's current structure, LIB MARKETPLACE, is set up in the  directory, and it is a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend with a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The new build will transition to FastAPI/React.



**Key Files/Directories Examined:**

-   : Identifies the existing project as LIB MARKETPLACE.
-   :
    -   : Python dependencies (currently likely empty or minimal, given Node.js backend).
    -   : Expected main FastAPI application file, but currently likely a placeholder or absent, as the existing backend is Node.js.
    -   : Environment variables for backend, e.g., .
    -   : Implements JWT-based authentication logic for existing Node.js backend, including , ,  functions.
    -   : Defines the Mongoose schema for User documents in the existing MongoDB, including fields like username, email, password, location, account type (buyer/seller).
    -   : Defines the Mongoose schema for Product documents, with fields like name, description, price, owner, images, and category.
    -   : Contains Express routes for user authentication (signup, login) in the existing backend.
    -   : Contains Express routes for user-related operations.
    -   : Contains Express routes for product-related operations (creation, retrieval).
-   :
    -   : Node.js dependencies and scripts for the frontend, currently indicating a vanilla JS/HTML setup, not React, and likely managing dependencies for the current frontend tools (e.g., Tailwind, PostCSS).
    -   : The main HTML file for the existing frontend, confirming its vanilla HTML/JavaScript nature, with inline scripts for basic marketplace functionality.
    -   , , , : These files are present, suggesting a *React template structure*, but the  indicates that the current functional frontend is vanilla JS. The previous AI engineer identified this as a mismatch. These React files would be the target for the new React implementation.
    -   : Contains  for frontend API calls.

The current setup is a Node.js/Express backend communicating with MongoDB, and a separate vanilla JavaScript frontend. The plan requires a full migration of the backend to FastAPI and the frontend to React, utilizing the existing MongoDB.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed a comprehensive exploration of the existing codebase and detailed analysis. They identified that the current application, LIB MARKETPLACE, is built with a Node.js/Express backend (using Mongoose for MongoDB interaction) and a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. This contrasts significantly with the required tech stack of FastAPI (Python) for the backend and React for the frontend, as specified in the environment setup.

The engineer meticulously reviewed the backend's directory structure, including , , and , examining specific files like  (for JWT authentication), , and  (for Mongoose schemas). On the frontend side, they found  indicating Node.js dependencies and discovered  as the entry point for the existing vanilla JavaScript frontend, despite the presence of  and  (likely placeholder React files).

Based on this analysis, a four-phase Implementation Plan has been proposed, covering:
1.  **Foundation Setup**: Migrating to the FastAPI + React + MongoDB stack, setting up basic user authentication with location validation, and creating enhanced product models.
2.  **Core Features**: Implementing shipping rate calculations, multimedia product listings, and a secure chat system.
3.  **Advanced Features**: Integrating payment processing and building the admin dashboard.
4.  **Testing & Optimization**: Performing end-to-end testing, performance optimization, and security testing.

The previous engineer's work left off by presenting this plan and explicitly asking for user confirmation to proceed.
