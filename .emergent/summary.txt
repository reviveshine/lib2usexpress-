<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully transformed the Liberia2USA Express application, moving from foundational features to advanced functionalities and a complete UI redesign. Initial efforts focused on robust user authentication, payment integration, and administrative controls. A significant portion involved extensive debugging, particularly resolving 503 errors, network connectivity, and URL configuration issues, often relying on backend testing agents. Key tasks completed include a comprehensive password reset system (mock email), a multi-faceted seller profile with ID verification and mobile money integration, universal Add to Cart functionality, real-time online status indicators, and a full aesthetic overhaul to a red, white, and blue patriotic theme with gold Liberian accents and cloud effects. The work demonstrated a systematic, iterative approach to development and bug fixing.

<product_requirements>
The Liberia2USA Express application is a cross-platform solution for international product shipping from Liberia to the U.S. It aims to provide comprehensive e-commerce functionalities including:
1.  **Shipping & Logistics:** Automated rate calculation, real-time tracking, and customs form generation.
2.  **Product Listings:** Support for multimedia, detailed descriptions, and search tags.
3.  **Secure Buyer-Seller Chat:** Encrypted real-time chat with file sharing and notifications.
4.  **Smart Checkout & Payments:** Secure shopping cart, real-time shipping fee calculation, multi-payment options (credit/debit, PayPal, mobile money), and auto-generated receipts.
5.  **User Accounts:** Separate buyer/seller accounts, secure onboarding with ID verification for sellers, and dedicated dashboards. This now includes a comprehensive profile tab with system-generated User IDs, addresses, shipping details, mobile money wallets, identity verification, and profile picture uploads.
6.  **Admin Panel:** Functionality for listing approval, dispute resolution, analytics, and user report management. This now includes a comprehensive Analytics tab for sellers.

The application, initially a Node.js/Vanilla JS app, was migrated to a FastAPI backend and React frontend with MongoDB. So far, foundational setup, multimedia product listings, international shipping, secure chat, and backend payment integration are complete. Frontend work for checkout, cart, and order pages, and specific bug fixes for cart, chat, and registration have been implemented. The application is live and has undergone significant debugging, particularly around deployment and network errors.
