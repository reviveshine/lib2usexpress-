The previous AI engineer was tasked with summarizing and sectioning the prior work on the Liberia2USA Express application, which was initially deployed with a patriotic theme. The core objective then shifted to updating the homepage to a Bridging Nations professional theme.

The trajectory details a complex deployment process to Hostinger, encountering numerous challenges related to Python 3.6 compatibility for the FastAPI backend and front-end deployment issues. The AI successfully updated the backend dependencies and server configuration. For the frontend, it attempted to deploy a new React homepage, but struggled with transferring large JavaScript build files and server-side routing for the React Single Page Application (SPA).

Initially, the AI focused on updating  and rebuilding the React frontend. Persistent issues arose from outdated static files on the Hostinger server and incorrect  configurations that prevented React Router from functioning client-side. The AI attempted multiple strategies, including manual  for small files, chunking for large JavaScript, and various  adjustments. Ultimately, it resorted to implementing a custom, plain JavaScript-based SPA routing mechanism directly within  to manage different pages (Login, Register, Marketplace, Shipping, Dashboard) without relying on a full React Router setup. Despite updating the  multiple times to correctly serve  for all non-API paths, a persistent issue with the login button (jumping back to homepage instead of showing the form) led to further debugging, including cache-busting and finally confirming that the client-side app is a custom JS SPA, not a traditional React app that relies on React Router. The current state is that all files are prepared, and the AI is awaiting user confirmation that the login button (and thus routing) is finally functional on the live site.

<product_requirements>
The Liberia2USA Express is an e-commerce platform facilitating international product shipping from Liberia to the U.S. Key features include automated shipping logistics, comprehensive product listings, secure real-time buyer-seller chat, a smart checkout with multi-payment options, robust user accounts with distinct roles and ID verification, and an administrative panel for overall management and analytics. The application was initially built using a Node.js/Vanilla JS stack and subsequently migrated to a FastAPI backend and React frontend, utilizing MongoDB for data persistence.

The application is currently deployed and functional on . It was initially displaying a patriotic red, white, and blue Independence Day theme on its homepage. The primary explicit request from the user was to upgrade this homepage design to a more professional Bridging Nations theme. Subsequent implementation has focused on achieving this design change and, crucially, ensuring all newly implemented navigation and page-specific functionality (e.g., login, registration, marketplace) are fully operational and correctly routed within a single-page application experience.

The application utilizes a monorepo structure, containing distinct  (FastAPI) and  (React/JavaScript) services, both designed to interact with MongoDB.



**Key Files/Directories Examined, Modified, or Created:**

*   : Originally intended to be the React component for the homepage. It was initially updated locally for the Bridging Nations theme. However, due to deployment complexities of a full React build, its content was not directly translated to the live site.
*   : This file (or a similar production env file) was checked to confirm  points to the correct production URL ().
*   : This is the live web root on the Hostinger server for . Frontend static assets and  reside here.
*   : This critical Apache configuration file was extensively modified. Initially for backend API proxying (), it was later updated to correctly handle client-side routing for the Single Page Application (SPA). The final version includes , , , and  to ensure all non-file requests are served , allowing the JavaScript to manage routes. It also includes cache control headers.
*   : This is the main entry point for the frontend. It was updated multiple times to reference the correct static CSS and JavaScript files, including a cache-busting timestamp for the JavaScript file to ensure browsers load the latest version.
*   : This file contains the CSS styling for the Bridging Nations theme. It was manually created on the server via  after being confirmed missing. Its purpose is to apply the visual design to the application.
*    (and ): This is the main JavaScript file for the frontend. Initially intended to be a React build, difficulties in direct transfer led to it being **re-implemented and manually written** with a custom plain JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) logic. This file now contains:
    *   The complete HTML structure for the homepage, login, register, marketplace, shipping, and dashboard pages.
    *    function for internal routing.
    *    functions (e.g., , ) to handle navigation via button clicks and prevent full page reloads.
    *   Basic local storage-based authentication (, ) for demo purposes.
    *   The final version was timestamped () to bypass browser caching.
*   : A locally created archive containing the full React build files, intended for easy deployment. While parts (like CSS) were manually copied from it, the main JS was eventually re-implemented.

<pending_tasks>
- Verify that clicking the Login button (and by extension, other navigation buttons) on  successfully displays the respective page (e.g., login form) without redirecting to the homepage or a 404 error.
- Fully confirm that the implemented custom JavaScript SPA routing is robust and covers all main navigation paths.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on resolving a critical routing issue on the live  site. Previously, the Bridging Nations theme was successfully deployed and visible, but all navigation buttons (like Login, Marketplace, etc.) were not functioning correctly; instead of navigating to the intended pages, they either redirected back to the homepage or resulted in a This Page Does Not Exist (404) error.

The AI engineer identified that the root cause was a combination of incorrect  configuration for a Single Page Application (SPA) and the JavaScript not handling client-side routing effectively for a non-React-Router setup.

**Recent Actions:**
1.  ** Update:** The  file in  was updated to correctly route all non-file requests to . This includes  and a  to ensure the client-side JavaScript can handle the URL changes without server-side 404s. It also added cache-control headers.
2.  **JavaScript () Update:** The JavaScript file located at  was comprehensively updated (now 23K size). This updated version contains a custom plain JavaScript-based SPA router with functions like , , , etc. It includes the complete HTML content for the homepage, login, registration, marketplace, shipping calculator, and a basic dashboard, dynamically rendered by JavaScript. It also incorporates demo authentication logic using .
3.  **Cache-Busting:** To ensure the browser loads the latest JavaScript, the  file was copied to a new filename with a timestamp (), and the  file was modified to reference this new timestamped file. This bypasses browser caching.

**Current State:**
All necessary files (, , , ) are confirmed to be in their correct locations on the Hostinger server, with appropriate content and permissions. The AI has performed all the necessary changes to enable functional single-page navigation. The AI is now awaiting the user to perform a final test on  by clicking the Login button to verify that the login form now appears as expected, indicating the routing issue is resolved.
